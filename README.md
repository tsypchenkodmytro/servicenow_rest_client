# ServiceNowRESTClient
REST Client for ServiceNow's TableAPI written in C#

The ServiceNow TableAPI Client is designed to provide quick and easy access to your ServiceNow instance's data through ServiceNow's REST TableAPI in a .Net application.  It is written in C#, however once compiled and referenced as a DLL, you could certainly use it in a VB project as well if you were so inclined.  JSON Serialization / DeSerialization is done with the Newtonsoft.JSON package and System.Net.WebClient is used to connect with ServiceNow.
